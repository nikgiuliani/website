              This was an idea I had this summer. I felt unsatisfied with
              current diet and fitness applications; normally, you have to have
              an application for each and they're not really geared for tracking
              progress and growth. Along with that, I personally have a struggle
              with the motivation to exercise and feel as though I want it to be
              more engaging and interactive to me. I wanted to feel like
              exercise wanted me to participate in it, in a weird way; I wanted
              exercise to be fun and motivational.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 15px">
              So, I decided to create an application that gamifies fitness and
              progress called Adonis. Currently in the early phases, Adonis
              eventually will track fitness and diet in a Duolingo-esque manner,
              providing levels of progress and encouraging growth, a section to
              input your progress for both fitness and diet, and the option to
              see how one's diet and exercise directly affect one another.
              Eventually, I want to grow the project to include other areas of
              health, such as mental health. But for now, the project is
              envisioned to be what I explained above. I feel like this idea
              could be a good one and do a lot of good for health promotion for
              those like me who just need a little extra lift and motivation.
              Demo incoming in the near future!

              A project I created with Angular, TypeScript, and Railway. This
              was made in response to a project assignment for a religious class
              taken during my university experience. I made the landing page,
              the Core Doctrines page, added all the links, implemented
              navigation, and deployed on Railway. It is a lightweight
              application with a front-end emphasis.

              Embark is a language learning mobile and desktop application used
              by missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
              Saints. I was privileged to be a member of the team on this
              application at the Missionary Training Center. While on the team,
              I created a variety of features ranging from new pages, alerts,
              and UI to entirely new features such as adding the option to redo
              an activity with only the questions the user got wrong. Before I
              was on the team, the project had been working on changing its
              image to be more attractive to users, and I helped continue to
              make the product attractive with the features I added. I worked on
              this application for a year, and during this time, it has reached
              tens of thousands of users learning dozens of languages and
              counting and has grown in popularity by over 10%.
